## 🔥 Core Features:

**Customizable Codegen (Component Code Generator)**: Freely customize component code generators based on various tech stacks, component libraries, scenarios, code specifications, and AI models.

![compoder-custom-codegen](./assets/codegen.png)

**1. Tech Stack Customization**

Customize Codegens based on specific technology frameworks (such as React, Vue, HTML...)

**2. Component Library Customization**

Customize Codegens based on any open-source & private component libraries (such as Mui, Antd, Element-Plus, Shadcn UI, company private component libraries...)

**3. Scenario Customization**

Customize Codegens for specific scenarios (such as Landing Pages, Email Templates, Admin Management Systems, APP Prototypes, Data Cards, Promotional Posters...)

**4. Code Specification Customization**

Customize Codegens based on specific code specifications (such as code file structure, styling approaches...)

**5. AI Model Customization**

Customize Codegens based on various AI models (such as OpenAI, Claude...)

## 🌟 Basic Functions

- Prompt (Text, Image) To Code: Input text or images to generate component code

- Code Version Iteration: Support code version iteration, view historical versions, and generate new code based on any version

- Online Code Fine-tuning: Support online code fine-tuning with an integrated code editor for intuitive code adjustment and saving

- Real-time Code Preview: Built-in real-time preview sandbox environment supporting various tech stacks (such as React, Vue, open-source packages, private packages) with second-level rendering

## 🛣️ Roadmap

We are continuously improving Compoder and will launch more exciting new features in the future:
